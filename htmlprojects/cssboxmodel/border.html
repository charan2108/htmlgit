                    The simple example shown above isn't pretty, but it is perfectly fine for illustrating a typical website layout example.
                    Some websites have more columns, some are a lot more complex, but you get the idea. With the right CSS, you could use pretty much any elements to wrap around the different sections and get it looking how you wanted,
                    but as discussed before, we need to respect semantics and use the right element for the right job.
